# simple-lunar-clock
A simple minecraft mod that adds a lunar clock that shows the moon phases.

This mod is a work in-progress, feel free to report bugs or suggest knew ideas. That said, I only made this mod as a first project in fabric modding so I probably won't add anything to it other than making it work properly.

# How to use?
The lunar clock is very similar to a regular clock. You'll see the phase of the moon on its texture. You can also put it on an item frame and it'll work just fine.

- When hovering over the lunar clock in your inventory, press SHIFT to see the current phase in the tooltip.

- When holding the lunar clock in your hand, press RIGHT-CLICK to be informed of the current phase.

- At this point there's no recipe to craft this clock and it can't be found anywhere.
