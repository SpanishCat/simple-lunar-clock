# Simple Lunar Clock
A simple minecraft mod that adds a lunar clock that shows the moon phases. I made this as an exercise in Fabric modding.


# How to use?
The lunar clock is very similar to a regular clock. You'll see the phase of the moon on its texture. You can also put it on an item frame and it'll work just fine.

- When hovering over the lunar clock in your inventory, press SHIFT to see the current phase in the tooltip.

- When holding the lunar clock in your hand, press RIGHT-CLICK to be informed of the current phase.


# Crafting 
A lunar clock is crafted just like a regular one or a compass, except that you'll use lapis lazuli instead of ingots:
